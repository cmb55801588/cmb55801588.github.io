<h1> The World's Smallest Bird </h1>
<table> <tr> <td> 
<p style="font-size:14pt"> The Bee Hummingbird <span style="font-style:italic">(Mellisuga helenae)</span> 
is the world's smallest bird. Female bee hummingbirds weigh around 2.6 grams, and are about 2.4 inches 
in length. The males are smaller than the females, and usually weigh around 1.9 grams and are around
 2.2 inches in length. Bee hummingbirds are comparable in size to large bees, hence their name.  </p> 
 <p style="font-size:14pt"> The bee hummingbird is endemic to Cuba, meaning they are only found there. 
 However, there have been reported sightings in the neighboring islands of Haiti and Jamaica. Bee hummingbirds
prefer the humid subtropical climate that Cuba offers because there are no seasonal extremes. They also 
prefer dense forests or edges of woodlands, because in these places they can easily find bushes. The bee
 hummingbird's diet consists entirely of flowers, which are also endemic to Cuba. </p>
 <p style="font-size:14pt"> When bee hummingbirds are first born, they have no feathers and are completely blind.
Young bee hummingbirds are fed by their mother's regurgitation for 20-40 days. About 22-24 days after 
hatching, the wing feathers of the bee hummingbird become fully grown, and the young birds leave the nest. </p>
<p style="font-size:14pt"> Currently, the bee hummingbird is listed on the IUCN (International Union for
 Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources) Red List of threatened species. The bee hummingbird
 is facing loss of habitat in Cuba, due to the conversion of land for cattle herding. Furthermore,
the recent expansion of cacao, coffee and tobacco production poses a serious threat to the birds. If you 
are interested in helping save the bee hummingbirds, you can follow this
